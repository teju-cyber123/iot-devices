Drones use rotors for propusion and control.
You can think of a rotor as a fan, because they work pretty much the same.
Spinning blades push air down.
Ofcourse all forces come in pairs which means that a the rotor pushes down on the air,the air pushes up on the rotor.
A typical unmanned aircraft is made of light composite materials to reduce weight and increase  maneuverability.
This composite material strength allows military drones to cruise st extreamely high altitudes.
Drones are equipped with different state of the art technology such as infrared cameras,GPS and laser.
Drones are controlled by remote ground control systems and also reffered to as a ground cockpit.
An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts the drone itself and the control system.
the nose of the unmanned aerial vehicle is where all the sensors and navigational systems are present.
the rest of the body is full of drone technology systems since there is no space required to accomodate humans.
the engineering materials used to built the drones are highly complex composites designed to absorb vibration which decrease
the sound produced.
 These materials are very light weight.
 there will be few types of drones.
 VTOL DRONES
 radar positioning and return home.
 UAE drone GNSS on ground station remote controller.
 Obstacle detection and collision avoidance technology.
 This is of about Drone.
